# Write a program that reads a list of words from the file words.txt and finds how many times each of the words is
# contained in another file input.txt. Matching should be case-insensitive.
# The results should be written to other text files. Sort the words by frequency in descending order.
#
#
# Examples:
#
#   words.txt:	                           input.txt:	                                    output.txt:
# quick is fault          -I was quick to judge him, but it wasn't his fault.                 is - 3
#                         -Is this some kind of joke?! Is it?                                 quick - 2
#                         -Quick, hide hereâ€¦It is safer.                                      fault - 1
